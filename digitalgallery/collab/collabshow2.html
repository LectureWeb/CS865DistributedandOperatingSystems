        ANDREYEV AND FOUR WHEEL DRIFT</strong><br>
        <a href="http://www.eciad.ca/%7Ejandreye/index.htm" target="_blank">Four-Wheel 
        Drift (remix)</a> examines urban culture through the use of a car as an 
        interactive, experimental VJ/DJ platform. During the remix installation/performance, 
        audio-visions of the city are repositioned into the public sphere of the 
        gallery; that which is private--the space of the car--becomes public and 
        a tool for commentary about the city. In preparation for the installation, 
        a car equipped with audio/video recording technologies, sensors and interactive 
        software cruises the city, analyzing data and recording samples. Sounds 
        from different areas in the car are recorded for use in generating the 
        remix and manipulated video of views from the car is created and archived 
        to provide visual storytelling of the city&#8217;s street culture. <br>
        In FWD (remix), the car is a self-contained creative recording and playback 
        device. During the performance, the video is projected from the car installed 
        in the space onto projection walls and the new audio remix is played back 
        via the car&#8217;s speakers. The car can be seen to be &#8216;recalling&#8217; 
        and &#8216;narrating&#8217; the experience of driving in the city. The 
        remix is set-up to play live, continuously generating new combinations 
        for the duration of the exhibition. <br>
        Four-Wheel Drift quotes a racing strategy that causes a controlled, sideways 
        slide while accelerating forward. Drifting is now a popular sub-culture; 
        its roots in the illegal auto-sport originating in Japan where drivers 
        would drift along curved mountain roads. Drifting competitions or &#8216;battle 
        drifts&#8217; are judged events that examine the performer&#8217;s speed, 
        angle and style. <br>
        FWD (remix) is site-specific in that it relies on the unique urban qualities 
        of the host city. Influenced by the Situationists International, (1957 
        - 1972), the project employs the tactic of the &#8216;derive&#8217; (literally 
        &#8216;drift&#8217;) to cruise the city seeking out urban performance.</font></p>

        <a href="http://www.research.umbc.edu/%7Ecazabon/" target="_blank">Marseille/Baltimore</a> 
        is a multi-media, bi-lingual installation consisting of video portraits 
        of people of these two post-industrial port cities. Between 2003-04, approximately 
        fifty residents of these cities were asked to speak about the most significant 
        technological device in their lives at that moment. The objects chosen 
        are often predictable (cell phone, laptop), sometimes surprising (metro 
        pass, highlighter pen), but invariably provide insight into the ways in 
        which everyday technological items become entangled in our lives. Each 
        interview represents a portrait of that person via the complex connection 
        to their chosen object. The color of the installation is designed to evoke 
        both sky and water, referencing the fact that both Marseille and Baltimore 
        are port cities. The overall audio experience as one first enters the 
        space is a murmuring of voices, as if one is entering a crowded party. 
        However, once the viewer decides to commit and sit down at one of the 
        viewing stations scattered within the gallery, they can experience what 
        is more like a one-on-one conversation. </font></p>

        MANDIBERG AND JULIIA STEINMETZ</strong><br>
        <a href="http://Turbulence.org/Works/innetwork" target="_blank">IN Network</a> 
        is an extended cell phone life-art performance about distance, communication, 
        intimacy, telepresence, and living together while apart. In August 2004 
        artist Michael Mandiberg moved to New York; Julia Steinmetz remained in 
        Los Angeles, postponing her move for a year because of commitments to 
        her job and her collaborative art practice. Faced with a year apart, and 
        the prospect of a long-distance relationship, the two artists got their 
        frequent flyer numbers handy, and switched both of their cell phones to 
        a provider with free &#8220;IN Network&#8221; service.<br>
        Michael and Julia started out having normal conversations, giving each 
        other updates about their days, and sending cameraphone pictures back 
        and forth, etc. As they switched to using hands-free microphones, they 
        began using the phone differently. They started doing things together 
        at the same time, 3000 miles away, via cellular connection: driving to/from 
        work, eating dinner, giving lectures to students, going for a walk, having 
        a cocktail, reading books in silence, falling asleep and waking up.<br>
        What began as a pragmatic attempt to make their relationship last the 
        year of separation through good communication, turned into something less 
        about communication and more about intimacy through (misuse of) technology, 
        and sharing (sonic-virtual) space.</font></p>

        <a href="http://www.trans.artnet.or.jp/candy/john/" target="_blank">Life 
        Sucks: 17 Personal Ads From the Yamaguchi Region</a><br>
        Our collaboration began gradually and casually. Takuji routinely collaborates 
        with other artists. He also organizes shows and web projects as well. 
        In 1998, he invited me to show digital projections of game show sets at 
        his project space in Yokohama, Candy Factory. For these, I used a video 
        grabber to take scenes from The Price is Right off TV. Then, I removed 
        all the figures from the set with Photoshop. Takuji responded to this 
        work with a series he called Non-Broadcasting Time. Here, he photographed 
        sets for Japanese game shows from oblique angles, emphasizing the fa&ccedil;ade-like 
        nature of the set. Then, using Macromedia&#8217;s Flash, he would squeeze 
        the images horizontally or vertically to produce the allusion of a camera 
        tilt or pan. This created a tension between the flatness of the image 
        and the space it suggested.<br>
        Takuji and I have never discussed long-range goals for our collaborations. 
        Rather, we work on the basis of a tacit understanding. I suppose we are 
        both interested in the way people and institutions misrepresent themselves 
        to themselves. We both know, however, that no representation is transparent. 
        Rather, it is the fa&ccedil;ade-like nature of representation that interests 
        us.<strong><br>

        MCDONALD, KELTY MCKINNON AND BECKLEY ROBERTS</strong><br>
        <a href="http://ivyleagueinvasion.net" target="_blank">Ivy League</a>, 
        a hypertext project from 2002, is a collaboration between Jillian Mcdonald, 
        a Canadian visual artist based in Brooklyn, and Kelty McKinnon, a landscape 
        designer based in Vancouver, BC. Hedera helix (English Ivy) has simultaneously 
        been glorified for its abilities to rapidly anchor erosive soils and filter 
        polluted air, and vilified as an invasive plant, which can rapidly dominate 
        native ecosystems, out-competing other plants for nutrients, sunlight 
        and air. The project documents ivy research and encourages visitors to 
        wander the city streets, scattering seed as they walk. <a href="http://jillianmcdonald.net/ivy" target="_blank">Ivy 
        League</a>, the public art performance, by Jillian Mcdonald and Beckley 
        Roberts in 2005, involved two performers who took opposing roles of anti-ivy 
        activist and gardener / ivy lover. They invited passersby in a public 
        mini-park to enter their garden and engage in dialogue.<br>
        On collaboration: &#8220;As a landscape architect, my approach to the 
        creative process is first and foremost site and research based. Much of 
        my work explores the possibilities of art and design as a catalyst for 
        interaction and memory by emphasizing the physical interface with social, 
        ecological, cultural and geomorphological history. My field tends to be 
        spatial, focusing not on objects, but on the relationships between things. 
        Perhaps because of this, collaboration has been an intrinsic part of site-based 
        work. The dialogue formed with governmental agencies, community members, 
        engineers, and architects necessitates a simultaneous letting-go and a 
        corresponding active engagement that, with all parties focused on the 
        project, often results in something much greater than the original intention. 
        Ivy League was developed through a similar double take of &#8216;letting 
        go&#8217; and &#8216;grasping-on&#8217; that pushed us into new territory. 
        For me, pushing the process outside the boundaries of professional or 
        academic practice allowed the work to become playful and humorous, while 
        maintaining a seriousness of intention.&#8221; ~Kelty McKinnon<br>

        RANDOLPH AND GLOWLAB</strong><br>
        The <a href="http://www.glowlab.com" target="_blank">Listen Now</a> project 
        is an ongoing series of environmental recordings. They invite a displacement 
        in the act of listening, from one person to another, one time and place 
        to another. Listening always takes place in the present but sounds are 
        also tied to the moment of their making. By now we take the displacements 
        of sound recordings for granted, but there is still something uncanny 
        about them. A sound environment is an unrepeatable composition, continuously 
        unfolding whether we give it our attention or not.<br>
        For the &#8220;Adjacent&#8221; series, I&#8217;m focusing on streets outside 
        of where my friends live and work. Beginning at my own front door, and 
        spiraling outward, I&#8217;ll be gathering recordings of street sounds 
        throughout May and June. Each site will be marked by a Listen Now sticker, 
        with a number that links to the recording from that site. <br>
        New recordings will be added weekly to the site throughout May and June 
        2005. Listeners are invited to carry the sounds back into public space 
        and listen to them either adjacent to where they were made (a displacement 
        in time) or outside the living and working spaces of their own friends 
        (a displacement of space and social network).<br>
        GLOWLAB is a Brooklyn-based community exploring psychogeography as it 
        relates to con-temporary art. They publish a bi-monthly web-based magazine 
        and produce events, lectures, projects and exhibitions. <br>
        Psychogeography includes just about anything that takes pedestrians off 
        their predictable paths and jolts them into a new awareness of the urban 
        landscape. In 2004 Joseph Hart wrote that &#8220;psychogeography&#8221; 
        was &#8220;a slightly stuffy term that&#8217;s been applied to a whole 
        toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities.<br>
