        Digital Artist-in-Residence</strong><br>
        The Pace Digital Gallery and The Center for Advanced Media (CAM) is pleased 
        to offer an independent artist's residency in Spring 2005. We are offering 
        a digital artist the opportunity to work with CAM's resources to produce 
        a new artwork.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Site</strong><br>
        The Center for Advanced Media (CAM) Is a research environment located 
        in Pace University's School of Computer Science and Information Systems 
        in downtown New York City. Its goal is to develop computer-oriented, human-centered 
        systems that help people solve problems by transforming the way they experience 
        the world and the way they collaborate within it. CAM is founded on Pace 
        University's collective faculty experiences in software engineering, human-computer 
        interaction, information visualization, and computer graphics. These computing 
        fields are fundamentally human-centric, with design as the common approach 
        to complex representational problems. Because visual artists, musicians, 
        and writers possess different perceptual, design, and representational 
        skills, CAM is interested in augmenting its computer science foundations 
        with participants who work in the arts and humanities to broaden the research 
        and educational mix. <br>
        <br>
        The Pace University&#8217;s Digital Gallery is an outgrowth of CAM's conceptual 
        foundation, executed as the combined initiative between CAM and Fine Arts 
        Department. Its goal is to foster the creation and understanding of digital 
        art for the benefit of Pace University and the surrounding community. 
        It furthers Pace University&#8217;s commitment to educational excellence, 
        diversity, and civic involvement by exhibiting curated work of leading 
        digital artists, as well as the work of Pace faculty and students. It 
        sponsors lectures and symposia on digital art, and supports publication 
        of materials for its documentation and promotion. <br>
        <br>
        The Digital Gallery&#8217;s first show entitled Digital Downtown opened 
        to rave reviews in Spring 2003. Since then it has co-hosted a Pan-American 
        collaborative performance event titled Acc&eacute;lerateur, an installation 
        of video works entitled Screen Kiss, an online exhibition eBay: Buy or 
        Sell or Buy, student and guest-curated shows. A series of talks by digital 
        artists began in Fall 2004.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Residency<br>
        </strong></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
        is an independent residnecy - the artist will be expected to work independently 
        on his her project except where technical expertise is needed, as outlined 
        in the proposal. <br>
        The artist-in-residence will have the opportunity to work with CAM faculty 
        and students whose research includes computer graphics, virtual reality, 
        image processing, human-computer interaction, and collaborative computing. 
        This work is supported by technology that includes a virtual reality display 
        system, networked PCs, multi-display and plasma display systems, projectors, 
        video cameras, scanners, etc. <br>
        The artist-in-residence will be expected to produce a new artwork during 
        their tenure at Pace (January 30 - May 10, 2005), which will remain the 
        property of the artist. Pace Digital Gallery will produce, with the artist, 
        a printed brochure about the work completed in residence, and will expect 
        the artist to give a presentation of their work to the Pace Community 
        and the general public. Pace Digital Gallery will also feature the artist 
        on our website, and in gallery space at Pace University - the artist will 
        be involved in all aspects of installation. There will be a modest stipend, 
        but no living accommodations or travel funding are provided. Access to 
        equipment will be Monday through Friday from 8:00AM to 6:00PM, and Saturday 
        from 8:00AM to 3:00PM. Artists outside of the New York area are welcomed 
        but are strongly encouraged to apply for external funding.<br>
        <br>
        Pace University affirms its commitment to the principle of equal Career 
        Opportunities as stated in Federal, State, and local laws, which prohibits 
        discrimination because of sex, race, age, ethnicity, marital or domestic 
        partnership status, national origin, sexual orientation, religion, disability 
        or veteran.<br>
        The artist will be chosen by a jury comprised of the gallery directors, 
        as well as a local artist and curator.</font></p>
