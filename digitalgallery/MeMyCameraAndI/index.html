<h1>Pace Digital Gallery is pleased to present <em>Me, My Camera, and I.</em></h1> <br />
      Curated by Jillian Mcdonald,
      the exhibition features four video artists who perform in their own videos using low tech, do-it-yourself methods.
      All four artists take found media as a starting point - whether Hollywood films, archival interviews, 
      or an audio tape found in a junk shop; humour and a sense of absurd pathos run throughout the work.</p>
        
        <div id = "odd">
       <img id="artistimg" src="images/Hearn.jpg" /> <p><strong>Kara Hearn</strong> is an interdisciplinary video artist. She makes quiet and
absurd work about the way tragedies reside in the head; the way
heroisms play out in the mind’s eye, the inside place where stories
get conjured, dreamed, remembered. Hearn’s work has been screened and
exhibited at such venues as Recess Activities, DiverseWorks, White
Columns, The Luckman Gallery, Pacific Film Archive, New Langton Arts,
the Walker Art Center, and the Dallas Video Festival. She received an
MFA from the University of California at Berkeley in 2007 and was a
Core Fellow at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from 2007-2009. She
currently works and resides in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
 
<p>ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER, 2007, 27 min 43 sec<br />
This video takes a look at the way travesties large and small hang
about; the way regret, grief, humiliation, and tension play themselves
out after the fact, shifting in and out of consciousness, repeating
endlessly, and being re-made along the way. Shot completely
alone by the artist using only costumes and props that were on hand.
</p>
<p>
REINCARNATED SCENES (E.T.), 2005, 1 min 27 sec<br />
These reenactments are the artist's effort to degrade and venerate the heroics
of Hollywood movies. By utilizing the techniques of cinema in the
simplest possible ways she hopes to recreate narratives that are stripped
of everything but the pathos inherent in the medium.</p>
</div>
 
 <div id="even">
 <img id="artistimg" src="images/Kobayashi.jpg" />
 <p><strong>Alison S. M. Kobayashi</strong> is a visual artist working in video, performance, installation and drawing. 
 She was born and raised in Mississauga and is currently working between Toronto and Brooklyn.
Her interest in found narratives resulted in two video works, From Alex To Alex and Dan Carter. 
Finding a lost letter in the first case, and a discarded answering machine tape in the second, Kobayashi imagines identities 
for each person mentioned in the narrative and then performs all the roles herself. In 2006 she won the TSV Artistic Vision Award 
for Best Local Short Film at the Toronto Reel Asian Film Festival and in 2007 was awarded the Mississauga Arts Award for Best Emerging Artist. 
Her films have been shown in Canada, the U.S., Spain, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>DAN CARTER, 2006, 14 min 58 sec <br />
"Dan Carter donated his answering machine to a secondhand store.
Dan Carter did not remove the cassette tape.
So I took it.
This film is based on the messages."</p>
<p>FROM ALEX TO ALEX, 2006, 6 min, 11 sec<br />
"In the fall of 2003 I found a letter on the Winston Churchill Blvd QEW overpass.
It was labeled From: Alex To: Alex.
This is a film based on the contents of that letter."

 <img id="artistimg" src="images/McCauley.jpg" /> <p><strong>Frank McCauley</strong>, a Jacksonville, FL native, received his BFA 
in painting from Winthrop University, and his MFA from Syracuse University. Frank has been the Director and Curator for Spark 
Contemporary Art Space in Syracuse, NY and is currently the Assistant Director and Chief Curator for the Sumter County Gallery of Art. 
As an artist he has been in numerous group exhibitions both nationally and internationally and has had solo exhibitions in CA as well as NY.  
Whether through printmaking, painting, video or performance, his work extends from an internal investigation of childhood role models, 
popular icons and cultural stereotypes and questions commonly held assumptions of how we construct our own individual identities.

<p>ACTION AT HOME, 2010, 2 min 52 sec<br />
THE SENTINEL, 2007, 4 min 24 sec<br />
<em>Action at Home</em> and <em>The Sentinel</em> utilize a “projection suit” in attempts to articulate mock relationships between real and fictional characters, 
their contexts, social environments and physical surroundings. They operate on the level of costume, disingenuous charade, and 
nostalgia and allude to the desire for a different kind of make-believe, an actual physical metamorphosis, but which ultimately fail, 
due to its impossibility and thus are relegated to the arena of fantasy and play.

 <img id="artistimg" src="images/Russell.jpg" />
 <p><strong>Adie Russell</strong> was born in Pittsburgh in 1971 and grew up around Europe and the US.
She currently lives in upstate NY where she is hard at work on her upcoming show <em>Most
Extreme Perfect That Exists.</em></p>

<p>WHO I AM, (RICHARD ALPERT), 2008, 4 min<br />
MOST EXTREME PERFECT THAT EXISTS, (INGMAR BERGMAN) <em>Work in progress</em>, 2010, 3 min <br />
These videos are part of an ongoing project in which Russell re-contextualizes audio
recordings from the 1950s and 1960s. In displacing the original visual cues and those
judgments that would ordinarily coalesce around them, she interrupts the historical
narrative and brings fresh meanings to the language. Her subject matter is often the
complex relationship between nature and selfhood and by bringing together two temporal
spaces: the historical moment of the audio recording and the space inhabited by the
artist, she aims to evoke an experience that is never fully grounded in time or identity.
