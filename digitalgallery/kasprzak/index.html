<br />
<p>At the Interactive City summit in 2006, design guru Matt Jones
conducted an informal poll that guests could respond to immediately
using their mobile phones. The poll was a fragment of a question:
Games or stories? This short but provocative query caused a low rumble
of chatter within the group, and within minutes results began
appearing, showing more or less a tie. What made the question
stimulating was that the two are so intertwined, it can often be
unclear where the story stops and the games begin. Can games live
without even the roughest hint of a narrative, and can stories develop
without an element of a game?</p>

<p>This exhibition presents two game environments that address both the
intertwining of games and stories and the aesthetics of artist-created
games. CuteXdoom II by Anita Fontaine and Mike Pelletier is a game
modification that transforms Unreal Tournament 3 into a digi-Rococo
experience. Players are tasked with the mission of piloting their
poisoned character, Sally Sanrio, through a world that is
simultaneously cute and sinister in search of the antidote. CuteXdoom
II expands the narrative developed in the first instance of the
project, wherein Sally Sanrio is drawn to the CuteXdoom cult, which
centres around the notion that 'the possession and worship of cute
material objects will ultimately lead to happiness'.</p>

<p>The <em>CuteXdoom</em> series utilizes the aesthetics of kawaii (Japanese style
of "cuteness") and otaku (obsessive fan-based culture of anime and
computer games), but these influences are ultimately just parts of the
overall style that emerges under Fontaine's direction. The incredible
level of detail, striking color palettes, and repeated patterns and
imagery are distinctly Fontaine's and contribute to a delightful and
dazziling game experience that is the aesthetic opposite of the
formulaic graphics usually delivered via the Unreal Tournament
platform. The CuteXdoom game aesthetic also responds to the story,
using darker imagery to emphasize the main character's altered state
due to the consumption of the poison.</p>

<p>Joe McKay's <em>Avoid</em> also breaks from the dominant aesthetic of
commercial games, and utilizes a look that is beautiful in its
minimalism. The premise of the game is to avoid the black dots, and to
"eat" the colored dots, with the pace of the game dictating a high
level of concentration from the player. The game was developed with
Processing, which is described by its creators as "an electronic
sketchbook for developing ideas." Avoid, too, can be seen as a
nearly-blank sketchbook upon which players can superimpose their own
traces of narratives: clinging to life (when you only get one),
consuming good, avoiding bad, acting in self-preservation. Though
Avoid is, at its heart, a puzzle game much like widely-known games
Tetris and Minesweeper, McKay's statement about the game includes
discussion of longevity, having only one life and making the most of
that one life, which immediately lends a rule-based puzzle more of a
human, narrative direction.</p>

<p><em>CuteXdoom II</em> and <em>Avoid</em> present two distinct approaches, which are
unified by their contributions to an evolving aesthetic of gaming.
These two works mark a stage in the use of game platforms and
structures by artists, which will see further evolution as technology
advances, more game platforms develop or open up, and a notion of what
games could be and could look like expands.</p>

  <p><em>CuteXDoom II</em> manipulates the platform of Unreal Tournament, a traditionally violent videogame, to 
  address the themes of obsession and fanatical adherence to ideologies, with particular reference to Japanese otaku culture.

  <p><img id="artistimg" src="images/JMcKayAvoid.gif" /> Joe McKay is a new media artist. Canadian born, 
  he currently lives in Oakland, CA where he is teaching a game design class at UC Berkeley. Joe likes getting 
  positive feedback and game play ideas so much that he's willing to give out his email (joester5 at mac dot com).</p>

In <em>Avoid</em> you must try to stay alive as long as possible. 
  At first this is easy, simply "avoid" the black dots. But soon, as the game-space gets more cluttered, 
  this becomes more difficult. Fortunately, there are the colored dots to help you. Each of these dots change 
  the game in some way, and the key to longevity is carefully timing their consumption.
This game stretches the mind to try and keep track of many things at once without concentrating too hard on any one object - 
and it's fun. <em>Avoid</em> the "home edition" is free for download from McKay's website, above.
