among others. To develop and explore new ideas, LoVid has been artist

received fellowships, grants, and awards from The Netherland America

including: Lightwave (The Science Gallery, Dublin), Evolution Festival

<p>Since 2001, Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus have been working
collaboratively under the artist identity of LoVid, combining their
complementary interests in visual art, technology, music, and science.
LoVid’s interdisciplinary work explores social, personal, and corporal
experiences in the networked era. LoVid’s performances include
sculptural instruments and explosive audiovisuals. LoVid’s
installations and objects draw visitors into visceral works,
preserving and extending the experience of live video. LoVid’s
object-based works are playful as well as aggressive, combining
hand-made and machine produced craft, DIY electro-engineering,
textiles, video, and noise. LoVid's recent work focuses on tactile
interactions between technology and the human body and engages the
audience as active participants.</p>

 <p><strong>Jill Magid</strong> seeks intimate relations with impersonal structures. 
 She is intrigued by hidden information, being public as a condition for existence, and intimacy in relation to 
 power and observation. Magid's solo exhibitions include the Whitney Museum of American Art; Tate Modern, London; 
 Yvon Lambert in New York and Paris; Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam; and Gagosian Gallery, NYC. Upcoming exhibitions 
 include the Singapore Biennial, and Berkeley Art Museum, California. Magid lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.
