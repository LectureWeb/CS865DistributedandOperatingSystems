  contribution to the field of New Media Art began during the euphoric dot.com 
  moment before the crash, and continues through the changing conditions surrounding 
  the Internet.&nbsp; Correspondingly, my work negotiated that moment.&nbsp; At 
  that moment the Net.Art community was involved in huge online discussions about 
  the acceptance of the form by the institution, and its inevitable inclusion 
  in the institution.&nbsp; The question was &quot;Is Net.Art dead.&quot;&nbsp; 
  This question, of course, has been raised about many many artistic movements.&nbsp; 
  The question is useful, but only if you read it against the grain.&nbsp; If 
  you ask, what are the conditions that have changed, and how has that shifted 
  the modes of production away from the ones that were before.&quot;</font></p>

  Mandiberg is a New Media Artist who uses the Internet, Video and performance 
  to explore subjectivity, labor, and commerce. He is interested in our everyday 
  experience of the Internet: all of the new forms that we engage with in our 
  everyday life as info-consumers, and which we don&#8217;t think about. These 
  include the home page, the search engine, the banner advertisement, the do-it-yourself 
  site, and the e-commerce site. He inserts personal information into these depersonalized 
  genres. His recent projects include the DVD exhibition First Person in collaboration 
  with Carla Herrera-Prats and Anne-Julie Raccoursier, and The Exchange Program, 
  a collaborative performance where four sets of two people switched lives for 
  11 days. To provide information for his partner he built The Essential Guide 
  to Performing Michael Mandiberg, an online do-it-yourself guide to his persona. 
  His work has been exhibited at such venues as Ars Electronica Center in Linz, 
  ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany, Transmediale Festival, Berlin, and C-Level, Los Angeles. 
  His work has been written about in The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, 
  The Berliner Zeitung, and Wired.<br>

  <font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Formally, 
  I see myself as a participant and investigator in the realm of new media art 
  as it exists on the web. The Web in its binary aspect mirrors the process of 
  choice-making by which we navigate our environments, making it an ideal medium 
  to discuss issues relating to the realm of subjective experience. Conceptually 
  my work derives from and revolves around my unchanging curiosity about the nature 
  of identity and consciousness. To me, identity is related to and generated by 
  what belongs to the spectrum of one&#8216;s history: subjective or objective, 
  microscopic or macroscopic, private, familial, and socio-political. Through 
  my work I attempt to address the difference between conscious and subconscious 
  identity and drives. In the frontier world of web technology I have found a 
  medium that encompasses and expands the lush, pluralistic and multi-layered 
  qualities of my previous dada-inspired photomontage work. Freed from the restricting 
  two-dimensional context by technological advances, I engage in fragmented narratives 
  and sub-narratives that form and reform as multiple windows open and close. 
  I orchestrate layers of history, including journal entries, sketches, written 
  records, video, photographs, music, voice and general sound loops, resulting 
  in a atmospheric investigation into states of being.</font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;</font></p>

  Peter Horvath works in video, sound, photo-based and new media. Camera in hand

  at the birth of the Web, co-founded 6168.org, a site for net.art, and adopted 
  techniques of photo-montage which he uses in his net based and 2D works. Exhibitions

  <font color="#333333" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
  started producing cultural objects 19 years ago by making programmed movies 
  using an Atari 2600. Since then, I&#8217;ve been exploring the connections between 
  technology and language. The comprehension of the duet language-technology led 
  me to develop methods and machines to address social, political, economical, 
  religious and philosophical issues. One of my firmest convictions is that poetry 
  transforms objects into art in the same way that it converts noise into music. 
  The relation poem-object that I outline redefines the role of the poet and our 
  experience of written poetry in today&#8217;s society. One example is the Poetic 
  Clock, a clock/machine that instead of giving the time gives poetry, which generates 
  86.400 different poems daily. Since poetry is subversive by nature, I also have 
  been doing work that shows the vulnerability of corporations, cultural/political 
  figures, and institutions - such as hacking into the email account of Venezuelan 
  President, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez; obtaining and reprogramming the source code of 
  the first 3D computer game ever made; appropriating the user&#8217;s database 
  of a large telecommunication company owned by Verizon, Inc; or getting and using 
  the credit card of the old British Artist, Damien Hirst.&quot;<br>

  Sound is a powerful means of transmitting information, and there is a growing 
  movement in the sonification of data, in other words, the interpretation and 
  presentation of data using sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of this presentation, 
  Eco-location, refers to the way bats and other animals can use sound as a means 
  to understand their complex&nbsp;&nbsp;environment in fine detail, but also 
  makes reference to ecological art, or eco-art. Eco-art helps to engender an 
  appreciation of the environment, address core values, advocate political action, 
  and broaden intellectual understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eco-location will outline 
  a series of projects that engender an appreciation of the environment through 
  the development of new languages for data interpretation. As the lives of individuals 
  and groups become more and more dependent upon the interpretation of large data 
  sets, a language or series of languages for communicating this mass of data 
  must evolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of sonification, data interpreted as sound 
  can communicate emotional content or feeling, and this series of data sonification 
  systems are designed to reveal the complexity of nature in a manner that touches 
  the emotions.<br>

  &quot;My recent projects have explored the integration of narrative with film 
  and architecture-based elements within a conceptual representation of space. 
  I incorporate photo-based imagery, texts and moving images in a layered space 
  that encourages simultaneous reading, hearing and seeing, and is spacialized 
  with sound. I am now working with formats that hybridize modes of 2D and 3D 
  representation to shape the subjective experience of space and create an active 
  environment for narrative. In Life Support the spatial coding of hospital architecture 
  was used to explore the intersection of sense of place with behavior, psychology 
  and physiology. Life Support developed a schematic 3D space incorporating composited 
  2D animation and using distortions of scale and perspective to advance narrative. 
  Waiting Room, a project in development, creates a 3D model of an archetypal 
  railroad station waiting room into which video and superimposed 2D image sequences 
  are inserted. It explores displacement, travel anxiety and associations between 
  physical space and memory through a series of fragmentary narratives. Waiting 
  Room and Life Support are part of an ongoing investigation of the symbolic aspects 
  of architectural space.&quot;</font></p>
