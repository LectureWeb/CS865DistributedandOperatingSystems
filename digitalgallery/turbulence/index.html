<p>INFO ABOUT THE ARTISTS</p>
 <div id="darkline">
 <p> <img id="artistimg" src="images/dubois.gif" float="left" /> <strong>R. Luke DuBois</strong> is a composer, 
 performer, video artist, and programmer living in New York City. He holds a doctorate in music composition from 
 Columbia University and teaches interactive sound and video performance  at Columbia's Computer Music Center 
 and at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. He is best known as a co-author of Jitter, 
 a software suite developed by Cycling'74 for real-time manipulation of matrix data. His music is available on Caipirinha/Sire, 
 Cycling'74, and Cantaloupe music. </p>
  <p>Dubois' <a href="http://www.lukedubois.com" target="_blank">website</a>. </p> 
  <p><em>Hard Data</em> is a data-mining, sonification, and visualization project
that uses statistics from the American military actions in Afghanistan
and Iraq as source material for an interactive audiovisual composition
based around an open-source "score" of events.  Using Xenakis'
understanding of formalized music as a starting point, the composer R.
Luke DuBois will use a variety of statistical data ranging from the
visceral (civilian deaths, geospatial renderings of military actions)
to the mundane (fiscal year budgets for the war) to generate a dataset
that can be used for any number of audiovisual compositions. The intention of the 
project is to recontextualize the formal stochastic music in the context of
real-world statistics, and to provide a compositional and
metaphoric framework for creating an electroacoustic music relevant
and significant to our time.

  <p><img id="artistimg" src="images/rothenberg.jpg" /> <strong>Stephanie Rothenberg</strong>'s interdisciplinary practice merges performance, 
  installation and networked media to create provocative interactions that question the boundaries and social constructs 
  of manufactured desires. She has lectured and exhibited in the US and internationally at venues including the 2008 Sundance 
  Film Festival, 2008 Zer01 San Jose, 2004/2008 ISEA; and the Knitting Factory, NYC.  Stephanie received her MFA in 2003 from 
  The Department of Film, Video and New Media at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is currently Assistant Professor 
  of Visual Studies at SUNY Buffalo</p>

<p><em>School of Perpetual Training</em>, an ironic edutainment website, exposes the underbelly and not so glamorous side 
of the computer video game industry. An animated personal trainer leads eager job seekers through a series of webcam 
game training exercises for outsourced jobs in digital game manufacturing and global distribution. Classic arcade games 
such as Dig Dug and Space Invaders are redesigned to train job seekers for positions in mineral mining and printed circuit 
board assembly. Pushing joystick and mouse aside, the webcam interface utilizes motion detection requiring full range of 
body motion to play. Through the relationship of physical labor for virtual gain, the reality of the actual physical, 
labor critical to running virtual worlds is made visible.</p>

      <div id="darkline">
      <p><img id="artistimg" src="images/hovagimyan.jpg" /> <strong>G.H. Hovagimyan</strong> is an experimental artist working in a variety of forms. 
     His work ranges from hypertext works to digital performance art, installations and HD video.<br />
     <strong>Christina McPhee</strong> is a media and visual artist whose work reflects on and interprets 
     generative environments at the edge of the urban. She is based in the central coast of California.  
     Current exhibitions include "Twice Upon a Time" at Galerie Andreas Huber Vienna and Silvmernan Gallery, 
     San Francisco. Her new science fiction project "Tesserae of Venus" debuted at Silverman Gallery 
     San Francisco in fall 2008 and in Belfast for the ISEA festival in August 2008. Her work 
     has recently shown at Documenta 12, Lyon Biennial 2007, Bucharest Biennial 3, and Bildmuseet Umea, Sweden.</p>

<p><em>Plazaville</em> is a new media video artwork based on the classic 1965 movie Alphaville by Jean Luc Godard. 
Set in 21st century New York City, the scenes from the original Alphaville are re-enacted, interpreted and 
improvised upon by the artists, actors and videographers. The piece uses the internet as one means of distributing 
the short video clips.  For Pace Digital the scenes will be projected as a randomly  assembled movie.</p>
