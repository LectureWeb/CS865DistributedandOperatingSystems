<p><big>Every day, in hundreds of the largest companies worldwide,</big>
software developers use tools like Rational Software's Rose, Computer
Associates' Paradigm Plus, and Microsoft's Visual Modeler to plan and
design software applications. In all these cases, the developers use
the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create virtual models for the
software systems they plan to build.</p>
<p class="BigQuote">Established as the premier software specification language, UML is now underpinning OMG's Model Driven Architecture.</p>
<p>Companies model complex software applications for the same reason
they hire architects to design buildings before actually having them
built. In the long run, a detailed blueprint saves time and money. It
allows developers to consider alternatives, select the best option,
work out details, and achieve agreement before anyone starts building
the application. It's much less costly to use a model than it is to
modify a building or an e-commerce application after it has been
assembled. More importantly, a good model documents the application's
structure and simplifies modifying it later. This is critical when you
consider that 90% of the costs involved in large applications occur as
they are changed, extended, and otherwise maintained.</p>
<p> UML is an open standards success story of the late '90s. In three
years, a dozen object-oriented modeling methodologies were replaced by
UML, which is currently supported by all major software modeling tools.
The Object Management Group (OMG) drove the rapid transition to UML and
continues to maintain it as the world's premier open, object-oriented
analysis and design standard.</p>
<p class="BigQuote">UML turns out to be a key ingredient in the new
model-driven development approach to software development proving so
popular with e-business developers.</p>
<p>As companies work to develop Internet portals, e-commerce, and
business-to-business applications, they use UML models to drive their
designs and maintain consistency. UML turns out to be a key ingredient
in the new model-driven development approach to software development
proving so popular with e-business developers.</p>
<p>At the same time, UML has served as the basis for another software
breakthrough&#8212;a universal approach to metamodel integration. Companies
will soon use metamodels derived from OMG's work with UML to
automatically integrate information about many types of applications
that use XML.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">Standardizing a Solution</p>
<p>In 1996 OMG announced it was interested in creating an open,
standard object-oriented notation and called for proposals. Rational
Software, Cupertino, Calif., submitted UML Version 1.0, which had been
developed by Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson. Ultimately, 21 other
companies sent proposals to OMG. In 1997, the submitting companies
blended their work into a seamless specification that covered most user
and vendor needs. OMG's version of UML represented the best efforts of
the teams from such companies as Hewlett Packard Co., Palo Alto,
Calif.; IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.;
Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.; Ptech Inc., Boston; Reich
Technologies, Brest, France; Softeam, Baltimore; and Taskon, Trondheim,
Norway. The OMG board approved the resulting UML Version 1.1
specification in November 1997. Since then, OMG has managed UML as an
open standard. An OMG task force gathers information about problems and
improvements, and also schedules revisions.</p>
<p>OMG's specification defines UML as "a graphical language for
visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of
a software-intensive system."</p>
<p>Because UML is an open standard, anyone can download the complete
specification from OMG's Web site free of charge. Similarly, OMG
controls the process of maintaining and extending UML, and any company
can join the standards organization.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier methods that combined a graphical notation system
and a procedural methodology, UML doesn't include a software
development methodology. When OMG issued its call for proposals, it
indicated it thought it was too early to try to standardize an
object-oriented methodology; the steps involved in developing
object-oriented systems vary too greatly. Developers creating a
transaction processing system follow very different steps from those
developing a real-time embedded system, for example. OMG suggested it
would standardize on a notation first and put off an effort to
standardize a procedural methodology.</p>
<p>OMG's UML is based on a common UML metamodel. The UML metamodel is,
in effect, a class diagram and a set of semantic and syntactic rules
that defines the core elements and relationships used in UML. As such,
the metamodel derives all other terms from that core set of elements
and relationships. Varying application development efforts call for
differing diagrams.</p>
<p>The UML metamodel ensures that UML is more systematic and internally
consistent than any earlier software modeling technology. At the same
time, it means that tool vendors know exactly how to transform an
element in a class diagram into its equivalent element in a sequence
diagram or a state diagram, and so forth.</p>
<p>In addition to core symbols, the metamodel contains supplementary
symbols, called extensions. Extensions are usually represented by
graphical adornments added to existing core symbols. For example, an
arrowhead added to a line indicates the relationship's direction. Also
featured are stereotypes, which are created by those interested in
customizing UML. The name of a stereotyped symbol is always put between
guillemets (e.g., &lt;&lt;stereotype&gt;&gt;). Using stereotypes, an
industry group can extend UML to incorporate some special-purpose
notational system. If the group follows the rules, and stereotypes are
derived from core UML elements, they can be incorporated into UML
diagrams and used by UML tools. An extensive package of stereotypes is
referred to as a UML profile. Any introductory book on UML will
introduce all the core symbols and most extensions.</p>
<p class="BigQuote">From its beginnings in the mid-'90s, UML has grown into one of the central software technologies of this decade.</p>
<p>UML allows developers to specify constraints on any diagram by
describing the constraint in ordinary language and placing it between
braces; for example, {constraint}. The OMG Analysis and Design task
force selected the Object Constraint Language (OCL), because it gives
developers a formal notation with which they can define complex sets of
constraints. OCL is based on the "design by contract" approach to
object-oriented design and calls for the specification of
preconditions, postconditions and invariants an object must fulfill.
The actual constraints are specified by rules.</p>
<p>OMG has provided for the automatic generation of Interface
Definition Language (IDL) code from UML diagrams. IDL is OMG's
language-neutral way of specifying object or component interfaces.
Common languages such as Java, C++, and Visual Basic are mapped to IDL.
Thus, with an appropriate tool, developers can begin with UML diagrams,
generate IDL descriptions of the diagrams, and then use IDL to generate
a description of the application in a regular computer language.
Likewise, common data structure formats like XML can be automatically
generated from UML diagrams.</p>
<p>Once the OMG revision task force process was in place, it decided on
a schedule that would guarantee that the language evolved
systematically, incorporating minor changes frequently and major
changes only at intervals that would enable developers and tools
vendors to keep up with the changes. (See Fig. 1.)</p>

<p class="ArticleSection">Beyond Software Architecture</p>
<p>E-commerce and supply chain integration systems are complex and are
developed in object-oriented languages like Visual Basic 6.0 or Java.
They rely on components, are distributed in multiple tiers, and often
require application servers like WebLogic from BEA Systems Inc., San
Jose, Calif.; WebSphere from IBM; iPortal from Iona Technologies,
Waltham, Mass.; and iPlanet from Sun Microsystems, Inc., Palo Alto,
Calif. They also must be integrated with existing applications. In many
cases, the applications spread across several companies, run different
platforms, and use legacy applications written in different languages.</p>
<p>To build these systems, developers must specify software
architectures that provide an overview of the systems and interfaces
the elements will use to facilitate communication. Companies also need
to develop component middleware and infrastructure to support locating
components and passing messages between diverse languages and database
formats.</p>
<p>Increasingly, sophisticated companies are going beyond simply
specifying a software architecture. They are creating business models
that provide a framework for all corporate applications. The model
describes the major components used in the business and how they relate
to each other and to the company's computer infrastructure. If the
model is specified in UML, as it is in most popular visual modeling
tools, corporate developers can later use the UML diagrams and the
visual modeling tool's facilities to generate IDL interfaces for
components. Similarly, the developers could automatically generate XML
from the UML diagrams.</p>
<p>This approach, which uses high-level corporate models or frameworks
to guide the actual development of specific applications, is termed
Model or Achitecture Driven Development. It is an increasingly popular
way of managing complex, distributed e-business systems, and government
organizations have taken notice.</p>
<p>Last November, the U.S. Department of Defense Science Board released
its "Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense
Software."</p>
<p>This report described the department's current status of software
development. It also made recommendations for reducing the cost and
improving the quality of future efforts. One key recommendation was to
adopt UML for describing application architectures. A second was to use
Model Driven Development.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">OMG's Architecture of Choice</p>
<p>To maintain the momentum behind UML and metamodeling interest, OMG
recently voted to adopt and promote Model Driven Architecture. (See
Fig. 2.) In effect, this architecture builds on OMG's decade of work on
CORBA and middleware services and uses UML, MOF, and CWM to integrate
CORBA with other middleware technologies and services. A company using
Model Driven Architecture would begin by creating a description of an
application using UML. Subsequently, using UML tools from leading
vendors, the company could generate code for CORBA IDL, XMI for XML, or
IDL links for Enterprise JavaBeans applications. Revisions would begin
with UML models and then be automatically propagated to system runtime
elements.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br>
<p class="Caption">Fig. 2. OMG recently adopted Model Driven
Architecture. A company using this could generate code for CORBA IDL,
XMI for XML, or IDL links for EJB applications. Revisions would be
automatically propagated to the system.</p>
<br>
<p>In a sense, Model Driven Architecture is a return to a more
structured approach to large-scale application generation and
integration. It will remind some of Computer-Assisted Software
Engineering (CASE). Unlike CASE, however, this current effort sponsored
by OMG is much more flexible. In most cases, companies will not seek to
generate complete applications from diagrams, but will use preexisting
components and middleware to link them. The Model Driven Architecture
approach is more focused on enterprise application integration than on
code generation.</p>
<p>In the next year or two, as more companies rely on Model Driven
Architecture to integrate their software applications and data
resources, the rule of UML, MOF, and CWM will continue to move toward
the center of enterprise application development efforts.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">Wells Fargo's Business Object Services</p>
<p>The Business Object Services organization at San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo Bank exemplifies UML's sophisticated approach. That
approach was described at a recent UML conference by Tony Mallia, a
senior architect with CIBER Inc., the Englewood, Colo.-based
consultancy that helped Wells Fargo develop its Model Driven
Development methodology.</p>
<p>Essentially, Wells Fargo's approach is to create a single business
model that, in turn, drives the development of specific applications.
The business model developed by the Business Object Services group
describes key elements required by these applications. It includes
business objects like "customer" and "account" and interfaces for every
component that might need to be accessed across the network.</p>
<p>The bank's business processing environment is complex and
multiplatform. (See Fig. 3.) BEA's ObjectBroker (CORBA) manages
interactions between components and applications running on different
platforms.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p class="CaptionSource">Source: CIBER Inc.</p>
<p class="Caption">Fig. 3. Shown here is Wells Fargo's complex,
multiplatform business processing environment. BEA's ObjectBroker
(CORBA) manages interactions between components and applications.</p>
<br>
<p>Wells Fargo's model is specified in UML and implemented in Rational
Software's Rational Rose modeling tool. The model provides a detailed,
logical specification of the major software components and how they
interact, including messages passed between components. Wells Fargo can
generate OMG IDL structure code for any message in the model.</p>
<p>Most Wells Fargo applications are created by development teams that
require the cooperative work of a client group (e.g., retail banking),
Business Object Services, and the systems organization that maintains
back-end systems and records. In effect, the Business Object Services
group contributes its model, ch defines the core business objects and
the interfaces, and the middleware infrastructure t. The application is
created by reusing objects defined in the Business Object Services
infrastructure, and in some cases, extending those objects. Application
developers create UML diagrams that describe the application. They then
generate IDL message code for the CORBA stubs and repository entries
that will be used in passing messages between application components.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">Metamodels and Enterprise Integration</p>
<p>At the same time that OMG has systematically evolved UML, it has
created complementary technologies that extend the power of UML beyond
its developers' original goals. Metamodeling has made this possible.</p>
<p>Metadata refers to any data that describes other data. Thus,
database record definitions are a kind of metadata. Similarly data-type
definitions in conventional languages and class definitions are
metadata in object-oriented systems. Data warehouse and enterprise
information portals also depend on metadata in the form of tables,
schemas, and dimensions. Middleware formats are also a kind of
metadata. Increasingly, as companies try to integrate applications to
build e-business systems or warehouse data, architects focus on
metadata and the models that define its various permutations .
Ultimately, system integration is the ability to translate from one
metadata format to another. Compatible metamodels allow tool vendors to
automate transformations between islands of data. At the same time, a
metamodel allows companies to catalog, index, and search enterprise
data and metadata assets in heterogeneous systems in ways never
possible before now.</p>
<p>A metamodel is a model of a set of models. UML is itself a metamodel
that describes all specific UML models or diagrams. Developers use UML
to create models of software applications. Then, based on those
application models, developers generate software to implement the
application.</p>
<p>Similarly, using the relational database model, developers generate
models of specific database applications and then populate those models
with actual data.</p>
<p>The OMG has formalized a vocabulary for metamodeling. It was found
that four hierarchical layers were sufficient to represent models. (See
Fig. 3.)</p>
<p>The OMG's meta-metamodel is called the Metamodel Object Facility
(MOF). MOF is a subset of UML that can provide formal descriptions of
metamodels, including both UML and MOF itself.</p>
<p>Once the OMG task force realized the power of using MOF to
standardize metamodel descriptions,, it decided it needed a standard
way to whipass information between metamodels and, by extension,
between all models.</p>
<p>The OMG Task Force selected XML as a way of packaging MOF and UML
information. OMG created an XML DTD language to pass metamodel
information. The DTD language is called XMI, the Metadata Interface
(XMI).</p>
<p>Using XMI, developers can specify Document Type Definition (DTD)
tags that become, in effect, words in a specialized language. XMI can
be transported over the Internet on HTTP, IIOP, or other wire
protocols. UML visual modeling tools are currently adding XMI
capabilities so that they can pass UML models from one tool to another.
In a similar way, developers can move information about UML models from
tools to databases that support MOF.</p>
<p>Last year, OMG completed the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM)
specification. CWM defines how specific data warehouse models relate to
each other. CWM models are described via UML, and the CWM metamodel is,
in turn, defined in terms of MOF. Oracle; IBM; Unisys Corp., Blue Bell,
Pa.; Hyperion Solutions, Sunnyvale, Calif.; and Dimension EDI, Surrey,
U.K., have already released CWM-compliant versions of their warehouses.
Because CWM is MOF compliant, CWM database users can pass information
about their models to MOF-compliant databases, via XML. In effect, any
CWM database can automatically reformat information, via XMI, into an
XML document that can then be sent over the Internet to other CWM
databases or data warehouses.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">The Government Computer-Based Patient Record Project</p>
<p>Another example of UML use is the Government Computer-based Patient
Record project (GCPR), developed with CIBER's assistance. This system
was designed to enable a variety of medical systems, from Veterans
Affairs and Defense Department treatment facilities to civilian health
services here and abroad, to exchange information.</p>
<p>The GCPR project was a joint effort that included the Department of
Defense, Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Indian Health Service and the
Louisiana State University Medical Center. These organizations, along
with the others that will eventually use the system, maintain medical
records on patient care, including illnesses, injuries, and
inoculations. Unfortunately, they maintain these records on different
computer platforms and have diverse ways of organizing, naming, and
coding the information.</p>
<p>The key to gathering all the information on a single patient is to
have a standard format into which information can be organized. Doing
that involves transforming data from various formats into a common one.
The infrastructure that does this is called the GCPR Framework.</p>
<p>The prime contractor for the GCPR Framework effort was Litton/PRC,
McLean, Va. Litton/PRC subcontracted CIBER to develop the model. Two
models were created. The government created the Reference Information
Model to describe information in patient healthcare records. Litton/PRC
developed the Framework Computation Model with CIBER's help. In effect,
Litton/PRC and CIBER collaborated with the government to ensure that
the UML reference model that described patient information could be
incorporated and processed by the framework.</p>
<p>Litton/PRC and CIBER also created the UML-based computation model
that described how any record could be reformatted to be compatible
with the GCPR reference model and released based on security and
privacy policies. The records involved can vary greatly. Some, for
example, might describe patient laboratory results, while others might
describe prescriptions. The computation model was created using a
metamodel that describes, in a generic way, how any system might
transfer medical records. At run-time, the metamodel is "downshifted"
to a model and drives Java code development. Without this approach, the
framework would have to be regenerated each time a record's format was
extended or changed. By using metamodeling techniques, CIBER was able
to help Litton/PRC develop a powerful, generic solution to the
transformation problem. This is important because GCPR is expected to
grow to incorporate more medical information.</p>
<p>The UML models were developed with Rational Software's Rose tool.
Unlike the Wells Fargo UML models, which generate OMG IDL code for use
with that company's CORBA middleware, the GCPR Framework Computational
Model is used for code design. The Reference Information Model is
currently transferred to the Litton/PRC Framework development team
using Rational Rose's proprietary format, which will eventually be
replaced with XMI.</p>
<p>Experiments are under way to generate XML DTDs directly from the
model to define XML exchange, but this will likely be overtaken by
Healthcare HL7, Version 3 standard XML messages, which are developed
from a Healthcare model developed in UML. Investigation is also under
way to merge government and HL7 reference models.</p>
<p>The GCPR system is in the pilot-testing phase. It will be ready for
general use after security and privacy designs are implemented.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">What's Next</p>
<p>In the early '90s, OMG set the pace in advanced software development
by pioneering technologies that facilitated distributed computing,
leveraging object-oriented techniques. Specifically, OMG created the
CORBA middleware architecture and its associated facilities to allow
companies to link object-oriented languages, components, and databases
to build large enterprise systems.</p>
<p>Today, developers have accepted objects and component languages but
are now focused on how best to architect Internet-based applications,
and integrate all their shiny, new legacy systems. And they now face
complex distribution and integration issues. Once again, OMG offers an
open, comprehensive solution. OMG's approach is based on the UML, MOF,
XML, and associated Internet standards. Using UML and MOF, companies
can describe any application they want to build and any tools or
facilities they want to use with that application, including databases,
warehouses, or middleware systems. By specifying applications in UML,
developers gain access, via XMI, to models or languages also specified
in MOF or UML.</p>
<p>Put another way, UML and its associated technologies can help change
the way developers think about modeling and integration. UML, coupled
with MOF and XML, is about to become the heart of a metamodeling
architecture that will make it possible for developers to transparently
link almost any software application with any other.</p>
<p>Metamodeling with UML is set to serve the next decade of developers
in the way that Object Request Brokers served developers in the '90s.</p>
<p>As OMG begins its planned upgrade of UML to Revision 2.0, 37
companies have signed on to define the new vision, the most ever to
submit to any OMG technology adoption process. It's going to be
interesting to watch OMG technology continue to evolve.</p>
<p>UML really has no competitors today. There are some real-time
methodologies like Shlaer-Mellor and component methodologies like
D'Souza and Wills Catalysis, but these have rapidly redescribed their
notations in terms of UML. It is the great strength of UML's stereotype
system that it can be extended to incorporate more specific notational
systems. Thus, although some developers may use earlier methodologies,
when they update to the latest version, they will probably find that
the UML stereotypes describe the notation they were using before.</p>
<p>Some developers and organizations have complained that UML is too
large and complex. In fact, when you consider all the diagrams and the
stereotypes UML includes, it can be overwhelming. In reality, however,
developers use only the notational elements and diagrams they need for
a specific project. Thus, most organizations use UML without being
aware of most of its more esoteric notations.</p>
<p>Microsoft developers provide a good example of this. Microsoft
includes Visual Modeler, the company's graphical tool, with its Visual
Studio package. Originally, Visual Modeler was developed in conjunction
with Rational and in fact supports only a few UML diagrams. Most Visual
Modeler users neither know nor care about complex UML diagrams. At the
same time, however, because they use UML, if they run into an
application that gets more complex than Visual Modeler is designed to
handle, they can readily switch their work to a more comprehensive UML
tool like Rational's Rose or Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer Associates'
Paradigm Plus. UML has certainly become the structured methodology of
this era. However, today's visual modeling tools aren't designed to
generate complete applications from diagrams the way the best of the
CASE tools were in days past. The problems involved in creating such
comprehensive tools has been avoided in favor of tools that help
developers conceptualize their applications but require that developers
generate significant portions of the application by other means. In
part vendors supported this approach to avoid complications encountered
when trying to generate a complete application. In part this approach
recognizes the fact that modern developers are much more likely to
reuse components, and that today's modeling tools are used more for
design than for code generation.</p>
<p class="ArticleSection">Marketing Challenges</p>
<p>Probably the biggest marketing challenges facing analysts and
vendors who promote UML is the desire of programmers to work informally
and companies to develop applications quickly and cheaply. This problem
will continue to haunt the software development industry as it
struggles to shift from a craft to an engineering discipline that can
reliably produce effective products. It's no secret that even today,
few large software projects are delivered on time or within budget.
Indeed, many large software projects are never delivered or fail when
they are. Most studies of this problem return to the same solution that
has been suggested for the last two decades: better analysis of the
initial problem and a more systematic development methodology. Both of
these depend on companies adopting and enforcing methods like UML.
Organizations of any size can take advantage of UML. Small
organizations can use tools like Microsoft's Visual Modeler simply to
examine the components they wire together to create interfaces. More
sophisticated organizations can use a wider variety of diagrams and
techniques to help design and deliver more complex applications. The
use of metamodeling and XMI to transmit UML between tools and databases
and to integrate diverse applications, however, is just being explored
and developed. Today, these techniques are mostly confined to large
companies with sophisticated groups of systems developers. It will be
several years before these newer techniques become embedded into tools
that smaller companies can easily use.</p>
<p>Today's UML users range from Microsoft developers, who use Visual
Modeler to diagram departmental COM-based applications, to the
Department of Defense, which uses more sophisticated tools to design
huge applications it takes years and hundred of developers to create.
By being more flexible and more modest, UML has appealed to a much
wider range of developers than CASE ever did.</p>
