<h1>JEstelle</h1>
<p>JEstelle could be described as a technique for the specification and development of distributed
applications
in Java. It is not, however, the only possible use of JEstelle. As JEstelle inherits several features of
well-known formal description technique - <i>Estelle</i> - we can use it as a handy telecommunication
protocols specification utility.</p>
<p>From the language construction point of view, JEstelle could be treated as a synthesis of Estelle with
Java (in place of Pascal). It is also convenient to look at JEstelle as a set of Java extensions. These
extensions allow the distributed system description to be performed using expressive power of Estelle for
distributed systems.</p>
<p>JEstelle do not only use a subset of Estelle, but also allows Estelle related tools to be used with
JEstelle as well. In fact, for every JEstelle specification there must exist exactly one specification in
Estelle. For JEstelle to Estelle conversion to be unambiguous and independent from the system provider a
special interface - <i>JEstelle Native Interface</i> (JENI) - has been developed and granted for all
JEstelle users.</p> 
<h4>JENI</h4>
JEstelle Native Interface is modelled on Java Native Interface (JNI) - a well-known technology from
the Java world. Thus, it is a set of procedures and functions allowing concrete Java constructs to be
expressed in an unambiguous way with Estelle. A natural consequence of the JEstelle/Estelle compatibility
is that a subset of the Java language used in JEstelle must be seriously restricted. This, however, does
not restrict the descriptive power of JEstelle as unrestricted Java may be still used in accompanying source
files (see the JENI manual and other documents for details).
