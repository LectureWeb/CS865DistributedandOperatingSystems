<h2>Commission>> Relay Mail</h2>
Relay Mail lets you identify a stranger on Facebook and use your social network to deliver a secret message. 
Turn your friends, your friends' friends, your friends' friends' friends into a personal courier service. 
Sending the message is only half the fun. In the process, discover the strength of your social network. 
Does your message arrive to its destination, or does it get dropped? How many people will have to be enlisted along the way? 
Relay Mail is part Pony Express and part Facebook hack, testing the limits of interaction in a highly controlled social space.

 <p><h2>Woody Sullender</h2>
 Woody Sullender is an artist currently based in Brooklyn, NY, working primarily in music and audio media.  
 Over the past few years, he has emerged as a pre-eminent experimental banjo performer, playing with 
 and against the cultural baggage of the instrument.  More recent work focuses on "erasing" existing 
 audio by removing most of the frequencies from a recording via band-pass filters.  This has manifested 
 in a range of media from a lathe-cut record of a diminished "Smells Like Teen Spirit" to an FM broadcast 
 of erased radio stations. Among other activities, he teaches new media in the New York area and hosts a 
 weekly radio show on WFMU.<br />

<h2>Commission>> Whispering Spectres</h2>
This project is an FM radio transmission broadcasting audio consisting solely of filtered live radio stations. 
These radio signals are being passed through many "band pass filters", a type of equalizer that allows a small range of 
frequencies through while attenuating frequencies outside of this range. In effect, most of the audio signal is "erased" 
except for a narrow band of frequencies. The piece highlights small, hidden musical moments that are occurring on FM radio, 
but are usually rendered inaudible by other elements in the sound. The basic gesture is reactionary, a reclamation 
of the acoustic landscape. Radio is designed to penetrate our homes, cars, offices, etc. delivering hyper-compressed 
audio at maximum loudness to target a segmented audience. This work filters the cacophony of multiple FM stations aimed 
at relatively diverse demographics ("urban contemporary", "modern country", NPR, etc.) into a unified, quiet space.

<p><h2>Adam Trowbridge and Jessica Westbrook</h2>
<strong>Adam Trowbridge</strong> explores the aesthetic possibilities that arise as communication breaks down.

The Grey Market and Anthology Film Archives, NYC; Pleasure Dome, Toronto; 
The Hyde Park Center, Chicago, IL; and festivals in France, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Korea, and Russia. <strong>Jessica 
Westbrook</strong>’s projects explore desire, visual cues, cultural artifacts, systems, language, and contradictory 
sensations that vacillate between great fortune and impending catastrophe.
She has exhibited work nationally and internationally including recent and upcoming projects for: gli.tc/h/ 
Chicago, Nature/Nurture Kinsey Institute, Carnegie Museum, and Experimental Media Series Hirshhorn Museum of 
American Art Smithsonian Institute. They work with the group Basekamp on

<h2>Commission >> Channel TWo: NYC</h2>
Eleven years into the new century, it is time to discuss the terms of surrender. Not a surrender to any civilization 
but the surrender of civilization to those in control who would use any political participation as a crutch for their failure. 
The question is not if but when giving up on civilization will be seen as the only rational political stance. Channel TWo is a 
post-network media channel that begins with entertainment-based narrative as a common language. Structurally, it employs internet
algorithms, viewer research and custom software to generate localized content. The outcome is a nonlinear, local media sequence 
that is directly connected to the community in which it is situated. Channel TWo begins after the inevitable surrender of 
civilization, a never-ending, visually-stimulating,  product-placement-based culture stream.</p>
