    <p><strong> Marina Zurkow</strong> (Brooklyn, New York) - <em>The Space Invaders</em><br />
      "How do you wage war on an abstract noun?" (Terry Jones)</p>
      <p>This work is a composite of live action footage and 2D character animation that plays off vaudeville 
     sketches, early cartoon pranks, and Grand Guignol's shock theater. USA's Homeland Security 
     Advisory System, particularly Code Orange, is made manifest as a set of characters who gallivant beneath the radar 
     in New York City. Rendered as fleshy, capricious agents, these particular "invaders" personify the nostalgic arcade 
     game of aliens who fall from the sky. The video's amoral crack-dwellers, hobs and giants who translucently roam the 
     streets come from inside, and not by spaceship or by airplane.</p>
      <p>Media artist and animator Marina Zurkow works with character and narrative in cartoons, installation, performance, 
      and pop objects. She has exhibited and screened internationally, including Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery, Sundance Film 
      Festival, Ars Electronica, FACT, Creative Time, and the Walker Art Center. Zurkow teaches at NYU's Interactive 
      Telecommunications Program, and lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

    <p><strong> Liselot van der Heijden</strong> (Queens, New York) - <em>You Show Me Yours and I'll Show You Mine</em><br />
   Ubiquitous cowboy John Wayne, inexhaustibly shows off acrobatic tricks with his gun.</p>
      <p>Liselot van der Heijden was born in Haarlem, the Netherlands and lives and works in New York City. 
      Liselot van der Heijden produces installations, videos, objects and photographs. Recurring themes in van 
      der Heijden's works are control and power of the gaze and 'Nature' as a cultural/political idea and anthropomorphic 
      projection. She has exhibited at various institutions throughout the US and Europe. Venues include Smart 
      Project Space in Amsterdam, Centre de Cultura Contemporania de Barcelona and the New Museum, the Queens Museum, 
      the Brooklyn Museum, Lincoln Center in New York City. Liselot van der Heijden is represented by LMAK Projects in NYC.</p>

    <p><strong> Paul Slocum</strong> (Dallas, Texas) - <em>You're Not My Father</em><br />
      This work is composed of a sequence of recreations of a 10 second scene from the television show Full House, 
      overlaid with sound loops from the scene's original music. The crews who re-shot the scene were recruited 
      through Internet message boards and Craigslist; each was paid $150. Instructions for shooting the scene and 
      delivering the footage were issued to the crews. The project includes participants from Austin, Cincinnati, 
      Chicago, Dallas, Denton, London, and San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Paul Slocum is a musician and new media artist. Computers and computer culture are often the medium 
      and subject of his work. He is also half of Tree Wave, a band that makes music and video using obsolete computer and 
      videogame gear programmed in assembly language, and he is director of And/Or Gallery, an art space in Dallas that 
      specializes in new media work. Paul's performances and exhibitions include Transitio MX (Mexico City), 
      The New Museum of Contemporary Art (NY), Deitch Projects (NY), Eyebeam (NY), VertexList(NY), The Liverpool Biennial.</p>

    <p><strong> Rick Silva</strong> (Athens, Georgia) - <em>A Rough Mix</em><br />
      Rick Silva remixes nature in this glitchy and poetic high definition work.</p>
		<p>Rick Silva is an innovative emerging artist whose work has been exhibited and screened in 5 continents including The Whitney Museum of American Art, Transmediale, and Sonar. He has performed his live video work in Tokyo, London, and Houston's Software Cinema Festival. His work often deals with the mix, those in-between moments where nature becomes culture, metaphor becomes documentary and time turns into rhythm.

    <p><strong> Tricia McLaughlin</strong> (New York, New York) - <em>Villa Savoye</em><br />
      Nanoarchitecture is the use of self-replicating materials for building structures. There's something fascinating 
      about the idea that if let run amok, nanoarchitecture could take us over in its infinite reproduction madness. 
      As Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye's own shadow tramples on the building, pink innards are pushed out of the interior. 
	Working with the remains of the original building, the pink gooey blobs start to form a new home. These breathing 
	blobs also stick to the shadow 'monster', adding to the changing form of the structure. In this animation the 'machine 
	for living in' is now a living machine.</p>
      <p>Tricia McLaughlin is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for her work in 3D design, animation and sculpture. 
      She has also been awarded two grants from the Jerome Foundation (Travel Grant, 2006 and Media Arts Grant, 2004) 
      and an Artist's Fellowship for Video from New York Foundation for the Arts. In 2006 she completed a 9 by 90 foot 
      animation of a virtual aquarium for a permanent public art commission at the City of Virginia Beach Conference 
      Center. Her work has been exhibited in the US, Canada, England, Germany, Spain, Russia, Chile and Japan. </p>

    <p><strong> Stephanie Lempert</strong> (New York, New York) - <em>Read My Lips</em><br />
      Addressing the role of language as one of many possible methods of communication, Lempert draws attention 
      to our use of the spoken word's interpretation within each society. Working with a speech pathologist to 
      decipher the 'words spoken' by each fish, the artist is able, through inflection and tempo, to bring new 
      meaning to the breath movements of common goldfish.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Lempert was born in Dallas, Texas and received her BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design.  
      Her work concentrates on analyzing various systems of communication and exists in a wide variety of media 
      including sculpture, photography and video.  Her work has been exhibited and collected domestically and 
      internationally at establishments such as A.I.R. Gallery, Socrates Sculpture Park, The Armory Show, Art 
      Basel Miami Loop Art Fair, Lmak Projects, Stella Art Gallery, The Moscow World Fine Art Fair, and The 2006 
      New York Video Festival.  Lempert is represented by the Claire Oliver Gallery in New York.</p>

    <p><strong> Orit Ben-Shitrit and Harold Moss</strong> (New York, New York) - <em>The Long from Inside</em><br />
      The Long from Inside is a digital time-based composition that gives a glimpse into a psychological state 
      reflecting both internal and external realities. At its heart is a reconstructed narrative of a quotidian 
      cinematic world that slowly begins to rupture.</p>
      <p>Orit was born and raised in Israel. She left for New York after a mandatory army service in search for the 
      meaning of life. After a quick search, she decided there is no meaning and became an artist. Tiro is her 
      Moroccan doppelganger demon and the star of some of her projects. She has been creating collages and 
      experimenting with gestalt laws of similarity and closure. Orit recently participated in exhibitions at
      Reed Whipple Gallery in Las Vegas; and White Box, Roebling Hall, Foxy Production -all in NY. 
      She won a NYFA Fiscal Sponsorship and Young Painters Competition in Miami U.</p>

	<p>Harold is founder/creative director of 
	FlickerLab (New York, NY), a multimedia animation and design studio for film, television, commercials, and 
	the Web. Notably, Moss was animation director for the three-minute cartoon, A Brief History of the USA, 
	in Michael Moore's Academy Award winning, Bowling for Columbine. He has created a wide range of animated 
	work across all mediums, including co-creating, writing, and directing the animated web series
	This Modern World by Tom Tomorrow, and is currently developing a surprisingly bloody animated 
	sitcom with a major cable network.</p>
