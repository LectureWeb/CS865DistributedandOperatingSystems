        is extremely pleased to present Luke Murphy's installation, <em><strong>The 
        Twelth Gate, Reflected</strong></em>. <br>
        This installation consists of three projections. The primary projection 
        will be of the source code from the script running the work and from code 
        written by students and faculty in the Pace School of Computer Science 
        and Information Systems - the same building which houses the Pace Digital 
        Gallery. This projection is divided into a positive image and its reflection 
        into a &#8220;virtual pool&#8221; of water - often referred to as the 
        &#8220;Lake&#8221; effect. This effect is commonly found on the web to 
        make images appear to be reflected in a softly rippling lake or pool. 
        A camera is aimed at this from across the stairway and its image projected 
        and reflected on another wall. Additionally, a second camera is aimed 
        at this and its image projected on another wall. It is a kind of house 
        of mirrors with a virtual reflecting pool.<br>
        The Twelfth gate in some alchemical texts is know as &#8220;projection&#8221;, 
        and is a step in the transmutation of matter from one form to another. 
        &quot;Reflection&quot; is a term used in some programming languages and 
        refers to the means by which an interface or function can describe itself 
        to a user &#8211; that is, reveal what it is. This work will start from 
        source code, normally hidden, project and reflect it and then do the same 
        to the space it resides in. </font> </p>

    <td colspan="2"><p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rev. 
        Luke Murphy is an information-based artist, based in New York, whose work 
        is united by common themes drawn from the impossible task of quantifying 
        the elements of the psyche and spirit. He has a particular interest in 
        the Gnostic gospels, Masonic ritual, religious paintings and digital languages 
        - in effect, codes. Amorphous concepts are dissected and reassembled using 
        the architecture of professional jargon and presentation techniques. Murphy's 
        incessant need to organize ostensibly promises the viewer the hope of 
        discovering a pattern or the key to the code and ultimately a shorter 
        route to meaning, understanding and mastery of complex situations and 
        emotions. This attempt to draw the connections within amorphous subjects, 
        which in theory should soothe the viewer by simplifying the complex, instead 
        reveals more layers of anxiety. The work's failure to deliver what they 
        ostensibly promise is at once menacing and reassuring. Murphy has been 
        producing and developing his work digitally since 1994 although a substantial 
        portion of his work involves drawing and painting. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Murphy has had solo 
        exhibitions recently at Canada Gallery in NYC; Wynick/Tuck Gallery in 
        Toronto; Buro Fur Photo in Cologne, Germany; and Home in Queens, NY. His 
        work has also been featured at vertexList in Brooklyn, NY; Greene Naftali 
        in NYC; M&auml;rkischen Museum in Berlin; and The Queens Museum of Art 
        in Queens, NY. He has given performances at The Kitchen and PS122, both 
        in NYC.<br>
        <br>
        Rev. Murphy graduated with an MFA from SUNY Purchase after completing 
        his BFA from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and a BS from the 
        University of Toronto. He is the co-director of cabinetmagazine.org and 
        Vice President of Web Development at MTV Networks. </font></p>
