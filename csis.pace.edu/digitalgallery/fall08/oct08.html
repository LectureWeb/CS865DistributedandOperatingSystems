   </td><td><p><b>Brooke Singer</b> likes to
work with emerging technologies not only because they are fun but also because they are malleable.
She is cofounder of the art, technology and activist group, Preemptive Media, and currently Assistant Professor of New Media at Purchase College,
State University of New York.
She exhibits and lectures internationally, including
at The Andy Warhol Museum; The Whitney Museum of American Art; and La Biennale de
Montréal. With her collective Preemptive Media,
Brooke was awarded the first Social Sculpture Commission by Eyebeam Art
and Technology Center and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council in 2005.
She has received grants from the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA), and Franklin Furnace.</p>
<p>Brooke Singer's work explores and blurs the borders between science, technology,
politics and arts practice. The form may
include a web site, video, installation, performance, toolkit, workshop,
lecture or combination of these elements. Her 
projects generally attempt to make the invisible visible (pollution,
surveillance, databases) and turn dusty data into dynamic experiences.
She views collaboration as a
type of microcosm (or beta-testing) for the larger dialogue she hopes her work
provokes.

    <p><b>Ricardo Miranda Zuniga</b> is an artist based in Brooklyn and an Associate
Professor of Art at The College of New Jersey
Ricardo's work has been exhibited internationally. He had recent exhibitions
at Laboratorio Arte Alameda in Mexico City; The National Center for Contemporary Art in St.
Petersburg, Russia; Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria; and The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York.
Currently he is a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow and a Tides Foundation Lambent
Fellow.</p>
<p>VOTEMOS.US questions how the 2008 United States Presidential Election 
would differ if all residents of the United States could vote. Currently only citizens 
registered to vote may participate in the election for the next President.  However within 
the borders of the United States reside nearly 40 million non-citizen residents, permanent 
residents, most legal, some undocumented, but all are active members of the U.S. economy 
and society. The artist feels that the majority of these residents would eagerly vote if 
given the opportunity. VOTEMOS.US presents an online Spanish language portal to the 
US presidential elections that allows users to register, vote and give their opinion on the 
US elections.</p>

<p>Since the start of 2008, VOTEMOS.US has been conducting video interviews with non-citizen 
residents to ask their opinion on the elections, the changes that they would like to see 
with a new president and who they would vote for if they could vote.</p>
