  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Product Size Risks</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>Few experienced managers would debate the following 
  statement: Project risk is directly proportional to product size. The 
  following risk item issues identify generic risks associated with product 
  size:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Estimated size of the product in LOC or FP?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Degree of confidence in estimated size 
    estimate?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Estimated size of product in number of programs, 
    files, transactions?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Percentage deviation in size of product from average 
    for previous products?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Size of database created or used by the 
    product?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Number of users of the product?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Number of projected changes to the requirements for 
    the product? Before delivery? after delivery?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Amount of reused software?</FONT> </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>In each case, the information for the product to be 
  developed must be compared to past experience. If a large percentage deviation 
  occurs or if numbers are similar, but past results were considerably less than 
  satisfactory, risk is high.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Business Impact Risks</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>An engineering manager at a major software company 
  placed the following framed plaque on his wall: "God grant me brains to be a 
  good project manager and the common sense to run like hell whenever marketing 
  sets project deadlines!" The marketing department was driven by business 
  considerations, and business considerations sometimes come into direct 
  conflict with technical realities. The following risk item issues identify 
  generic risks associated with business impact:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Affect of this product on company revenue?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Visibility of this product by senior 
    management?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Reasonableness of delivery deadline?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Number of customers who will use this product and 
    the consistency of their needs relative to the product?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Number of other products/systems with which this 
    product must be interoperable?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Sophistication of end users?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Amount and quality of product documentation that 
    must be produced and delivered to the customer?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Governmental constraints on the construction of the 
    product?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Costs associated with late delivery?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Costs associated with a defective product?</FONT> 
    </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>Each response for the product to be developed must be 
  compared to past experience. If a large percentage deviation occurs or if 
  numbers are similar, but past results were considerably less than 
  satisfactory, risk is high.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Customer -Related Risks</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>All customers are not created equal. Pressman and 
  Herron [PRE91] discuss this issue when they state:</FONT></P></UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<P><FONT face=Palatino size=2>Customers have different needs. Some know what 
they want; others know what they don't want. Some customers are willing to sweat 
the details, while others are satisfied with a vague promises. Customers have 
different personalities. Some enjoy being customers–the tension, the 
negotiation, the psychological rewards of a good product. Others would prefer 
not to be customers at all. Some will happily accept almost anything that is 
delivered and make the very best of a poor product. Others will complain 
bitterly when quality is lacking; some will show their appreciation when quality 
is good; a few will complain no matter what. Customers also have varied 
associations with their suppliers. Some know the product and producer well; 
others may be faceless, communicating with the producer only by written 
correspondence and a few hurried telephone calls. Customers are often 
contradictory. They want everything yesterday for free. Often, the producer is 
caught among the customers' own contradictions.</FONT></P></DIR></DIR>
<UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>A ‘bad’ customer can have a profound impact on a 
  software team’s ability to complete a project on time and within budget. A bad 
  customer represents a significant threat to the project plan and a substantial 
  risk for the project manager. The following risk item checklist identifies 
  generic risks associated with different customers:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Have you worked with the customer in the 
    past?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the customer have a solid idea of what is 
    required? Has the customer spent the time to write it down?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Will the customer agree to spend time in formal 
    requirements gathering meetings (Chapter 11) to identify project 
    scope?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the customer willing to establish rapid 
    communication links with the developer?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the customer willing to participate in 
    reviews?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the customer technically sophisticated in the 
    product area?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the customer willing to let your people do their 
    job–that is, will the customer resist looking over your shoulder during 
    technically detailed work?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the customer understand the software 
    engineering process?</FONT> </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>If the answer to any of these questions is "no," 
  further investigation should be undertaken to assess risk 
potential.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Process Risks</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>If the software engineering process (Chapter 2) is 
  ill-defined; if analysis, design and testing are conducted in an ad hoc 
  fashion; if quality is a concept that everyone agrees is important, but no one 
  acts to achieve in any tangible way, then you've got a project that is at 
  risk. The following questions are extracted from a workshop on the assessment 
  of software engineering practice developed by R.S. Pressman &amp; Associates, 
  Inc. [PRE95]. The questions themselves have been adapted from the Software 
  Engineering Institute (SEI) software process assessment 
  questionnaire.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Process Issues</B></FONT></P>

    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>If a majority of the above questions are answered 
    "no," software process is weak and risk is high.</FONT> </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Technology Risk</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>Pushing the limits of the technology is challenging and 
  exciting. It's the dream of almost every technical person, because it forces a 
  practitioner to use his or her skills to the fullest. But it's also very 
  risky. Murphy's law seems to hold sway in this part of the development 
  universe, making it extremely difficult to foresee risks, much less plan for 
  them. The following risk item checklist identifies generic risks associated 
  with the technology to be built:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the technology to be built new to your 
    organization?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do the customer's requirements demand the creation 
    of new algorithms, input or output technology?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the software interface with new or unproven 
    hardware?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the software to be built interface with vendor 
    supplied software products that are unproven?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the software to be built interface with a 
    database system whose function and performance have not been proven in this 
    application area?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is a specialized user interface demanded by product 
    requirements?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do requirements for the product demand the creation 
    of program components that are unlike any previously developed by your 
    organization?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do requirements demand the use of new analysis, 
    design or testing methods?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do requirements demand the use of unconventional 
    software development methods, such as formal methods, AI-based approaches, 
    artificial neural networks?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do requirements put excessive performance 
    constraints on the product?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is the customer uncertain that the functionality 
    requested is "do-able?"</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>If the answer to any of these questions is "yes," 
    further investigation should be undertaken to assess risk potential.</FONT> 
    </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Development Environment Risks</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>If a carpenter were asked to create a fine piece of 
  furniture with a bent, dull hand saw, the quality of the end product would be 
  suspect. Inappropriate or ineffective tools can blunt the efforts of even a 
  skilled practitioner. The software engineering environment supports the 
  project team, the process, and the product. But if the environment is flawed, 
  it can be the source of significant risk. The following risk item checklist 
  identifies generic risks associated with the development 
  environment:</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is a software project management tool 
    available?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is a software process management tools 
    available?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are tools for analysis and design available?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Do analysis and design tools deliver methods that 
    are appropriate for the product to be built?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are compilers or code generators available and 
    appropriate for the product to be built?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are testing tools available and appropriate for the 
    product to be built?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are software configuration management tools 
    available?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Does the environment make use of a database or 
    repository?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are all software tools integrated with one 
    another?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Have members of the project team received training 
    in each of the tools?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Are local experts available to answer questions 
    about the tools?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>Is on-line help and documentation for the tools 
    adequate?</FONT> 
    <LI><FONT face=Palatino>If a majority of the above questions are answered 
    "no," the software development environment is weak and risk is high.</FONT> 
    </LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino><B>Risks Associated with Staff Size and 
  Experience</B></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Palatino>Barry Boehm suggests the following questions to assess
